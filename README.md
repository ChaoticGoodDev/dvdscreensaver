## Retro DVD screensaver ðŸ“€

A friend of mine wanted me to create a screensaver to utilize in their streams and I needed some practice.

As such, I modified the code created by https://github.com/boglarkasebestyen/dvdscreensaver to fit my needs. All credit for the original code is theirs - all I did was modify a few things.

To modify the image, just replace the "logo.png" file with your image.
